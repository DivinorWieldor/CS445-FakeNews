# CS445-FakeNews
Term project for CS445-NLP course. It aims to detect fake news on the LIAR2 dataset. The project model is based on the work by Jadhav and collaborators (refer to CS445-Project notebook for a link to the paper).

The main codebase for this project is located within the CS445-Project notebook. This notebook contains a non-functional model "Model 1," created with heavy assistance from chatGPT. Following this, the notebook contains "Model 2," created by following the works of Jadhav and co. to the best of my abilities. Finally, the notebook contains a Naive Bayes model for benchmark purposes.

The functional Model 1 can be found in the DSSM_LSTM_LIAR2-Fariz notebook. This functionality has been the only major contribution of Fariz but that's neither here nor there.
